S3 : Simple storage Service

Volumes = EBS (Elastic block Storage) = Block based storage
Shared Storage = EFS (Elastic File System) = network based storage, we have to mount..

S3 is Object based storage.. You upload anything, it will be treated as an object..

Store any flat files.. pdf, mp3, mp4, documents, .xyz... You can store anything here..

We store data into Buckets..

bucket = Folder / Directory, but with unique namespace.

we can store unlimited data into an s3 bucket

No Pre-Provisioning required

bucket name should be unique across the globe.

Min : 3 char, Max: 63 char
Must use lower case letters and numbers
Cannot start with . 
cannot end with . 
no adjesent ..
Should not resemble an IP address (192.168.100.1)

Object = Anything you upload to s3 bucket.

Min object size an s3 bucket supports : 0 Bytes
Max object size an s3 bucket supports : 5 TB

If you want to make any object Public : Block public Access
--> Account Level settings
--> Bucket level settings
--> Object level settings

--> Enable ACLs one time.

S3 Standard : Frequently Accessed data.. 99.99% Availability, 99.999999999% Durability.. 
--> Data will be available without delay.
--> Data replicates ">=3 AZs"

S3 Standard-IA (Infrequently Access) : Infrequently accesses data.. 
--> Data will be available without delay.
--> Data replicates ">=3 AZs"

S3 OneZone - IA :Infrequently accesses data.. 
--> Data will be available without delay.
--> Data stores only in 1 AZ

S3 Instant Retrival : Once in quarter, we can access data without delay
S3 Glacier Flexible Retrival / S3 Glacier Deep Archieve :: Designed for long term archieval.. 
--> We need to initialise the restoration to access the file..
--> Data replicates ">=3 AZs"

S3 Intelligent Tier : When we are not sure about our data access patterns, we can go with this.

S3 Versioning

S3 Versioning allows you to maintain multiple versions of an object within the same bucket.
By default, versioning is in a Suspended state for any bucket.
Once versioning is enabled, S3 will keep track of all versions of objects in the bucket.
Delete Behavior
Typing "Delete" when deleting an object:


---

Replication Rules
Cross-Region Replication (CRR) / Same-Region Replication (SRR)
Replication ensures objects are copied from a source bucket to a destination bucket.

Requirements:

Both source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled.
Existing objects are not replicated; only future uploads are replicated.
To replicate all existing objects, AWS offers AWS Batch job to replicate. Cost US

---

Lifecycle Management Rules help automate object transitions and deletions to optimize storage costs.

S3 Standard → Standard-IA → Glacier → Delete

S3 Standard → Glacier → Delete

S3 Standard → Delete

S3 Static Website Hosting : 

--> No Server Required.
--> Automatically we get S3 platform "availability - 99.99%" and "Durability - 99.999999999%".
--> No configuration efforts required.

Http error codes:

2xx : ok/success
3xx : Redirection errors
4xx : Client Side error (Forbidden, non found, unautherozed)
5xx : Server side error (internal server error, request timeout, server busy/unresponsive)

---

Bucket Policies:

I have an IAM user, who has "S3 Full Access".. But in one specific bucket we have sensitive information that need to protect data from Deletion and upload for this specific IAM user... 

4 points..

1. Bucket ARN
2. Principal / IAM Role/User ARN 
3. Effect : Allow/Deny
4. Actions to take Effect(3) : PutObject, getObject, DeleteObject


Bucket Level operation : arn:aws:s3:::avinash-qcli-test
Object level Operations : arn:aws:s3:::avinash-qcli-test/*

If you are not sure, add both... 

Bucket ARN : arn:aws:s3:::avinash-qcli-test
User ARN / principle : arn:aws:iam::982424467695:user/s3-admin
Effect : Deny
Actions : DeleteObject, PutObject

---

Default S3 performance:

Read Operations : 5,500 GET Object operations per Second per prefix.. 
Write operations : 3,500 PUT object operations per second per prefix..

--> Use more prefixes
--> Increase uniqueness in Object names

Governance : Users with specific IAM permissions can overwrite or delete protected object versions during the retention period.

Compliance : No users can overwrite or delete protected object versions during the retention period.

10 TB Data.. 

1 pb --> 1 gbps --> 20-23 years

AWS Snow Family : We can order physical devices and perform data transfer to/from AWS S3 service.

snow mobile : Its a PB scale container..
