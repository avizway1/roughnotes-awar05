S3 : Simple storage Service

Volumes = EBS (Elastic block Storage) = Block based storage
Shared Storage = EFS (Elastic File System) = network based storage, we have to mount..

S3 is Object based storage.. You upload anything, it will be treated as an object..

Store any flat files.. pdf, mp3, mp4, documents, .xyz... You can store anything here..

We store data into Buckets..

bucket = Folder / Directory, but with unique namespace.

we can store unlimited data into an s3 bucket

No Pre-Provisioning required

bucket name should be unique across the globe.

Min : 3 char, Max: 63 char
Must use lower case letters and numbers
Cannot start with . 
cannot end with . 
no adjesent ..
Should not resemble an IP address (192.168.100.1)

Object = Anything you upload to s3 bucket.

Min object size an s3 bucket supports : 0 Bytes
Max object size an s3 bucket supports : 5 TB

S3 Versioning

S3 Versioning allows you to maintain multiple versions of an object within the same bucket.
By default, versioning is in a Suspended state for any bucket.
Once versioning is enabled, S3 will keep track of all versions of objects in the bucket.
Delete Behavior
Typing "Delete" when deleting an object:

Replication Rules
Cross-Region Replication (CRR) / Same-Region Replication (SRR)
Replication ensures objects are copied from a source bucket to a destination bucket.

Requirements:

Both source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled.
Existing objects are not replicated; only future uploads are replicated.
To replicate all existing objects, AWS offers AWS Batch job to replicate. Cost US

Lifecycle Management Rules help automate object transitions and deletions to optimize storage costs.

S3 Standard → Standard-IA → Glacier → Delete

S3 Standard → Glacier → Delete

S3 Standard → Delete
