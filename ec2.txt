EC2 : 

1. On-Demand Instances : Unpredictable workloads.. or shortterm testing purpuses..
	--> No Commitment with AWS
	--> Pay-as-you-go Model : Pay for the resources you actually uses
	--> /sec billing (Minimum 60 sec)..

2. Reserved Instances : suitable for "Predictable workloads" for lobger duration (1 Yr - 3 Yrs)

	--> Standard RI : No config changes allowed.
	--> Convertible : Confi changes can be modified (Instance family / OS)

Payment Option:

	--> Full Upfront : Pay 100% upfront.
	--> Partial upfront : Pay 30-50% upfront, Remaining Monthly basis.. With "Redused hourly price".. 
	--> No upfront : Pay entirely on monthly basis.. 

--> We can sell instance in AWS marketplace, if we dont want to use it anymore.

3. Spot Instances : For Flexible workloads with "NO Critical Data".
	--> You bid your price against AWS pricing.
	Usercase : Testing / temporary environments.
	--> High config server, at low cost, with no affect for interruptions.. 

--> if AWS Price exceeds your bidding price, ec2 instance will be terminates.. 

--> Instance termination performed by AWS, Price changed.. You no need to pay for partial hours.. ( 1 hr 50 minutes --> AWS terminated --> 1 Hour)

--> Instance termination performed by User, Price unchanged.. You no need to pay for full hours.. ( 1 hr 50 minutes --> you terminated --> 1 Hour 50 minutes)

Step 1 : provide a name (Tag)

Tag --> Combination of key and value pair. We can provide metadata to our instance.

Step 2 : Need to choose AMI (Amazon Machine Image)

OS --> AMI

Step 3 : Instance Type (CPU, Memory)

Application : Demo-app

General Purpose : Balanced Compute, memory, netowking.. : t2, t3, t4g, m4, m5
CPU : CPU-Intensive Tasks : c4, c5
Memory : RAM : memory Optimised : Database, distributed web sale im-memory : r4, r5, x1, z1
Storage : Input and Output Operations per Second : nosql db, datawarehousing : d2, d3, i 
GPU Optimised : Machinelearning, Ai, Gaming.. f1, p , g

Step 4 : Create a keypair and use same.

Helps to get default username and password.

Step 5 : 

OS contains some ports : 

Windows : RDP (Remote Desktop protocol) : 3389 
Linux/unix : SSH (Secure shell) : 22

http : 80
https : 443
mysql : 3306
mssql : 1433
NFS : 2049

Source Type : 
1. Anywhere : 0.0.0.0/0 (Not recommended setting at enterprise level)
2. My IP : Your currently connected network IP address.
3. Custom : We can provide custom network IPs based on or/client requirement.


Step 6 : Storage : 
Windows 30 gb
Linux : 8 / 10 gb


Step 7 : Review and create

-------

How to connect:

Windows OS : 
1. Start --> search "Remote Desktop" --> open
2. Open "run" (windows key + r) --> type "mstsc" --> RDP tool
3. choose the instance "connect" --> RDP client --> Download remote desktop file --> open it

MacOS : navigate to "app store", Install "Microsft remote desktop"

How to launch and Connect to Linux EC2 Instance.

--> AL2023 

EOS : End of Support --> We can still use it, (No updates, no support, no bug fixes)
EOL : End of Life --> We canot use after the give date. 


Default USer name : ec2-user


ssh -i awar-05-fa.pem username@server-ip

ssh -i awar-05-fa.pem ec2-user@13.203.66.42
