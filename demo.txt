# Full Upfront : Pay all money and purchase the required infrastructure components (server, network, database, storage, applications, security applicances)

ON-Demand : pay for the resources you actually using.. (1 server = 1 hour = you pay for 1 hour) (5 min - $)


Pay-as-you-go : Pay for the resources you are actually using.


Capital Upfront : Investing amount before starting the business : less/No upfront cost
operational Maintenance : Cost involved for business operations : less operational cost

BAU : Business as usaual : 

Forgot Password / Disable User / Delete User..

--> AWS managed  : AWS provided, Based on Services we get this.
--> AWS Managed - job function : AWS provided, Based on Standard job roles in market, we get this.
--> Customer managed : Customer Created, Based on customer requirement, he can create/edit/delete these.


AWS managed : Limited to specific Service
AWS managed - Job Function : AWS prepared this policy based on the standard job and the job roles we have in current market.


Authentication : Username and password --> loging
Authorisation : What permisisons you have on the account. 

S3Admin : S3 Full Access : Login (Success) --> S3 Allowed to access --> RDS (Not authorised)
EC2Admin : EC2 Full Access : Login and verify his access on EC2 service and other services (s3/rds)


Imlicit Allow : if you add a policy to a user, he can access only those resources. All other resource access wont provide to this use.

Explicit Deny :  you allow 100 times, deny only 1 time, Deny will take effect. THis called as explicit deny.


Limitations : An IAM user can have only 20 managed policies directly.

Customer managed Policy : Customer creates based on his requirement. 


Service : AWS service that the policy targets. (S3 / ec2 / rds ..)
Effect : The result of the policy, Which can be "Allow" or "Deny"
Actions : The operations permitted or denied (Putobject (upload), getobject (readobject), DeleteObject) / *
Resources : The specific resources the policy applies to. (s3 bucket / ec2 instance / rds database)


* --> asterisk / Everything / every operation / anything

---

Scenario : Need an IAM user, he should able to access all the services in this AWS account, 
But He shouldn't able to access S3 as it contains some sensitive data. 

UN : test-user
Policy : AdministartorAccess

---

Scenario : need an IAM user, who can access any bucket in this account. But he should not able to "Upload" object to one specific bucket (sdfughdsufgdsuyf)


---

"inline Policy" : Directly embedded into a single user, group or role.

--> Whenever any user reached maximum number of managed policies.
--> A single policy can contains maximum of 6,144 characters only.

--> Not reusable : We cannot reuse these polocies with other resources. 
--> Hard to track : These are embedded into a single entity/resource. Hard to track.

1. Developer : S3 --> upload --> ??? : S3Admin & S3Admin (S3 full access).. 
IAM Policy : S3FullAccess (Condition)
--> Resource level restrictions.. 
--> verify "permissions Boundary"


2. How many AWS accounts you are using and why.??
Ans : Environment : SDLC (Sandbox/Training, Dev, QA, UAT, UPT, PROD, COB/DR)

3. In your aws account, what support plan you guys are using.?

---

least privilages mechanism : Developer (S3, RDS) --> Deleted User


Dev : FullAccess

Dev : Dev
Dev : QA ..??
Dev : Prod..??

---

How you can track an IAM user activity.?

--> Cloudtrail : by Defaultly enabled in all aws accounts.
--> It can store only last 90 days activities.
--> You cannot alter/modify/delete these logs.
--> Everything you do (Including refresh) stores in this cloudtrail.


You need to create a trail to store logs for unlimited days. 
--> All logs will be stored in S3 bucket.

---

Credentials Report : This report helps us to identify password, last logged in info.

---

Permissions Boundary : Use to set maximum permissions for an IAM user. 

---

IAM Policy Simulator : The simulator evaluates the policies that you choose and determines the effective permissions for each of the actions that you specify.

---

IAM Access Analyzer : We can identify the resources shared from our account to another AWS account or Public.

External access : Free 
Internal access : Â£9/AWS resource/month
Unused access : $0.2 / IAM user and role / month

---

IAM --> CLI COnfiguration : 

First "Download the AWS CLI" and install it in your laptop.
