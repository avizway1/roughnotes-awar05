RDS : Relational Database Service : 

--> Amazon Aurora (Mysql Compatable & PostgreSQL compatable)
--> Microsoft SQL / MSSQL : SSMS (SQL Server Management studio)
--> MySQL : (mysql workbench / workbench)
--> PostgreSQL : pgadmin / dbeaver
--> mariaDB : workbench

1. Create a DB Subnet group with 2 Private subnets we created in our Custom VPC.

Hardware configuration.. OS Installation.. OS patching..
DB Software installation and configuration.. Backups.. High Availability..

2. Create a Security group, Open port based on Db Engine (mysql: 3306) to Source as "ec2 instances SG/Jump Svr SG"..

EOL : Every Db engine will have End of Life.. We need to upgrade it before reaching EOL.

--> In Org, We always follow n-1 mechanism.. 

Storage Autoscaling: This feature helps RDS to add addl storage automatically.

BinLog: The MySQL binary log, or binlog, is a crucial component of MySQL's architecture, serving as a record of all data-modifying operations performed on the database.
