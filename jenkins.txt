Jenkins has a pre-requisite: We should have java installed..

Jenkins runs on port 8080


sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
sudo yum upgrade
dnf install fontconfig -y

dnf install java-21-amazon-corretto -y

dnf install jenkins -y

systemctl enable jenkins --now

systemctl start jenkins
systemctl enable jenkins

Job / Item / Pipeline : 

Environment Variables: 

NAME=Avinash
echo "hello $NAME"		--> hello Avinash


Local variable : We can define variables inside the pipeline.. It is limited this particular item.

NAME=Avinash
COURSE=Jenkins
echo "Hello, THis is $NAME Welcome to mastering ${COURSE}"

---

System variable : We can define variables at Jenkins system settings.. It can be used in any of the item..
PROJECT = DevOpsproject
OWNER = Avinash

PROJECT=JenkinsProject
echo "hello this is for a $PROJECT and this is maintained by $OWNER"

What is i overwrite a system variable with local variable.??

jenkins Variable : http://13.201.177.117:8080/env-vars.html/

echo "THis is a test pipeline and this build id is: $BUILD_NUMBER , THis is running in $NODE_NAME"

Build options in Jenkins:

Build Periodically : Regardless of the changes happening on git, pipelene triggers periodically.

Poll SCM : Peridically, based on given time it will check for code changes, during the period, if any changes occured, it will trigger the pipeline.. 

GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling : THis helps to trigger the pipeline based on commits happening on the repo.. No periodical checks..
